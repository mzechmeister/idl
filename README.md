# idl - helpful tools for IDL

[gplot.pro](gplot.pro) and [ds9.pro](ds9.pro) are wrappers for [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info) and [ds9](https://ds9.si.edu).
You can plot and display IDL arrays. This provides a nice alternative to the IDL build-in procedures `plot` and `surface`.<br>
[iplot.pro](iplot.pro) allows to display the gnuplot images in [IDL Jupyter notebook](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/docs/IDL_Kernel.html).
Likewise, the `ds9show` procedure provides ds9 snapshots for Jupyter notebook.

Programs were developed on Linux systems.

The docstring the files provide some examples for usage.
